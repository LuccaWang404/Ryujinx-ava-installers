## Latest Build
Due to the limitations of the Inno Setup Script, all build operations must be done manually, no deployable workflows (such as GitHub Actions) have been found so far.
I am working on this project in my free time. As a student, I may not be able to keep all versions up to date in time.
These builds are only for Windows. Official builds for Linux / macOS can be found on the [Official Website](https://ryujinx.org/download).
